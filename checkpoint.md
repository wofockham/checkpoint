# Javascript Assessment


### Variables

1. Assign the string "Jack" to a variable called `captain`
<br><br>

2. Using the `captain` variable, use string concatenation to form the string "Oh Jack, my Jack!", assigning it to a variable named `phrase`
<br><br>

### Arrays & Loops

assume to the following array:

```javascript
var days = ['Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
```

1. loop through the array to print the following

```
0 Thursday
1 Friday
2 Saturday
3 Sunday
```

### JS loop

write a loop that print out the following:

```
16 bananas
14 bananas
12 bananas
10 bananas
8 bananas
6 bananas
```

### Data Structures - JS Objects

assume the following object
```javascript
var brain = {
  energyLevel: 10
}
```

2. write code to add a `dream` property to the `brain` object with the string value `'electric sheep'`
<br><br>

3. write code to add a `dayDream` property to the `brain` object with the value `{ lunch: ['burger', 'beer'] }` 
<br><br>

4. write code to add `'pudding'` to the beginning of the lunch array
<br><br>

### Objects

assume to the following object:

```javascript
var dog = {
  name: 'fluffy',
  age: 4,
  hairColor: 'pink'
}
```

1. research the builtin `Object.keys()` function and use it to console log all the property names as an array


### JS Functions

1. Write a function isOdd that accepts a number as a parameter and return a boolean to indicate wether the number is odd or not

examples of calling the function in the console
```
> isOdd(2)
< false
> isOdd(3)
< true
```

2. Invoke the function with 6 as arguments and save it to a variable named `result`

### bonus

given the following array
```javascript
var studentYearOfBirths = [2001, 1975, 1992, 1998, 1988, 1994]
```
1. write code to calculate the students average age

2. if you used a `for` loop solve this again using `forEach`
